# NoDeathEXP-for-MCBE

NoDeathEXP is an internal mod (DLL) for Minecraft Bedrock Editon that stops you from losing EXP upon death.
## DISCLAMER
THIS MOD MOST LIKELY WONT WORK IN MULTIPLAYER!!! (not tested)
## Installation
Install the DLL file from releases or compile the source code yourself.
## Usage
To use this mod your going to have to inject the DLL file into Minecraft (if your confused google DLL INJECTION) you can do this by using [MCBE-DLL-INJECTOR](https://github.com/ambiennt/MCBE-DLL-Injector) (any other injector should work fine). 
 if you properly injected the DLL a console should appear that says some things (closing the console will close mc).
