# NoDeathEXP-for-MCBE

NoDeathEXP is an internal mod (DLL) for Minecraft Bedrock Editon that stops you from losing EXP upon death.

## Installation
Install the DLL file from releases or compile the source code yourself.

## Usage
To use this mod your going to have to inject the DLL file into Minecraft (if your confused google DLL INJECTION) you can do this by using [MCBE-DLL-INJECTOR](https://github.com/ambiennt/MCBE-DLL-Injector) (any other should work fine).
## Contributing
if you want to add anything to this feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request. if you properly injected the DLL a console should appear that says some things (closing the console will close mc).
